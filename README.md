# Data-Driven-Evaluation-Of-Toronto-Apartment-Buildings

The project evaluates the conditions of Toronto apartment buildings using the Apartment Building Evaluation Dataset sourced from the Open Toronto website. Through detailed analysis and interactive Tableau visualizations, the project aims to identify maintenance issues, trends, and regional disparities impacting resident satisfaction and safety. The findings are intended to support data-driven decision-making by policymakers, property managers, investors, and other stakeholders, contributing to the improvement of housing standards across the city.
